# Seoul-bike-rented-
This is a project I did on the Data camp workspace...
Kindly download the Seoul bike data.csv file with 8760 rows and 14 columns. 
I intend to explore this data more as this is just an overview working with numpy, pandas and plotly.Practicing plotly.
I should try matplotlib as that was my initial package of interest but it was proving difficult.
